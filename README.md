## Introduction

PyNotiCenter is a multithreaded task queue and message notification center. It mainly provides in-process lightweight task scheduling management for client applications, that why we choose the multi-threaded mode. Although the multi-threaded mode is not a good practice most of the time. But in developing client applications, it will be one of the most important base components.

As it is based on a multi-threaded mode, multi-threaded development must pay attention to thread safety issues, which is inevitable. In order to reduce the complexity for developers, all interfaces of this library are thread safety. It is designed to be called in any thread to guarantee the same results as expected, even though this will cause some performance issues.

The library mainly provides 2 features.

* Task queue: each task queue will run in a separate thread. 
* Message notification: the message notification scheduling is based on the built-in task queue.



## Install

```shell
pip install pynoticenter
```

## Code Example

* Post task to task queue.

```python
def fn(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any):
    print(*args)

def main():
    PyNotiCenter.default().post_task(fn, "hello world")
    PyNotiCenter.default().post_task_with_delay(5, fn, "hello", "world", "delay 5s")
    PyNotiCenter.default().shutdown(wait=True)
```

```shell

```

* Notification

```python
class A:
	  def say_hello(who: str):
  	    print(f"{who}: hello")

def main():
    receiver = A()
    PyNotiCenter.default().add_observer("say_hello", receiver, receiver.say_hello)
    PyNotiCenter.default().notify("say_hello", "baby")
    ...
    PyNotiCenter.default().remove_observers(receiver)
    PyNotiCenter.default().shutdown(wait=True)
```

* Notification on specific thread, such as Gtk main thread.

```python
def fn():
    pass 

def switch_to_gtk_thread(fn: callable, *args: Any, **kwargs):
    GLib.idle_add(fn)

def main():
    queue = PyNotiCenter.default().create_task_queue("mytask")
    queue.set_preprocessor(switch_to_gtk_thread)
    queue.post_task(fn) # fn run in gtk thread
    
    # notification run on mytask queue.
    PyNotiCenter.default().add_observer("say_hello", None, fn, options=PyNotiOptions(queue="mytask"))
    PyNotiCenter.default().notify("say_hello")
```
